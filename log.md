# 100 Days Of Code - Log

`Write Record Descending date order`

## Day 1: Nov 4, 2020

#### Today's Progress

Learn to create parser

#### Thoughts

It was so difficult for me to understand various parser. Read text, write sample code, Read text..., I'm unconfident using today's learning as my programming skills.
Anyways, I should remember it with my body if I can't remember it with my head.

Writes As many as one line, one character everyday.

Learn create Scala's animation, GUI

#### Thoughts

The first day of [Write Code Everyday](https://johnresig.com/blog/write-code-every-day/).
I tweet my progress it on every weekend. ([#WriteCodeEveryday](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23WriteCodeEveryday&src=typed_query))

I've definitely done #WriteCodeEveryday. So, my spirit and humanity will grow by having this experiences. 

I give this word by Richard M Nixon to myself a year later.
