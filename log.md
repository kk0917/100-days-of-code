Learn characteristic of lazy val syntax in Scala language

lazy val doesn't only initialize by first access, it initialize again when exceptions are thrown in the middle of initialization.

So, Scala initialize processing every time it access until initialization success. This is an effective choice to the lazy initialization of resource.

#### Thoughts

I said "refactoring...", but I do not a big deal. tidied up codes indent, add blank lines between variables and function codes, delete unneccesery comment annexed codes that understands the intention without writing it... 

In short, I refactored codes more readable. It's important and helpful for another person maintains this code in the future to do it. I think The best thing is that it's easy to maintain.

You can generate the directory structure, definition file, etc. when starting a Scala language project with sbt. This template is packed with various useful tools. Unit test tool, test coverage tool, testing framework, code formatter, code style checker, and GitHub Actions CI workflow.

#### Thoughts

TO introduce One tool of them is easy, but it's very annoying and boring to introduce all of them at once.

	- Scrape zip file number from a target site, request HTTP POST with zip file number into request body, and fetch zip files.

#### Thoughts

It was first time to create the scraping programming. Scraping looks like E2E test automation tools. Selenium, Cypress etc. Both are sober and steady work, but it's important things to work Sincerely.

By the way, coding 100 days challenge is too short for my programming life. So, I changed 1000 days challenge.
